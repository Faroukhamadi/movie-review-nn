      "The core dataset contains 50,000 reviews split evenly into 25k train\n",

      "\n",
      "In the entire collection, no more than 30 reviews are allowed for any\n",

      "movies, so no significant performance is obtained by memorizing\n",
      "movie-unique terms and their associated with observed labels.  In the\n",
